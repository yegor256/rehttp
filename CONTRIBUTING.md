Fork repository, make changes, send us a pull request. We will review
your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly, provided
they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration, before
sending us your pull request please run full Maven build:

```
$ mvn clean install -Pqulice
```

To avoid build errors use maven 3.2+.
